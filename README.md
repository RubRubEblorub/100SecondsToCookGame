# 100 Seconds To Cook Game
Game files and source files of my first project "100 seconds to COOK"

This is fully opensource project as I took free course from YouTube channel "Code Monkey"
and used his assets to learn the basics of Unity, C# and other cool tools to create my
first game.

For this project I cloned all ideas from free course and add some features myself, including:
1. Score system: earn score by delivering orders;
2. Combos system: deliver combos to double score and extra time for a short period of time;
3. New design for main menu, restaurant and player model;
4. New recipes, food, drinks and self-made model of refrigerator and potato (raw fries too);
5. New tutorial image;
6. New options, including hide/show tick for tutorial image, reset your highest score button;
7. A bit messy but new player moving sounds;
8. New animations for player, customers, workers, kitchen counters and UI.
9. Some minor changes like rebalance of everything and visual improvements compare to free course

Again, HUGE THANKS to Code Monkey for his hard work!

I'm planning to grow my skills and keep in mind some ideas for the next fully standalone
project: "metroidvania" like 2D platformer game.
